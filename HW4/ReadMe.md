# Network Analysis of Contacts in Workplace

**Abstract**
The EU Agency for Safety and Health at Work states that 1”At workplaces where workers can be exposed to a virus, employers have to carry out a workplace risk assessment and set appropriate measures”. In lights of the current global sanitary situation many companies have taken different measures to ensure the safety of their employees. These can range from the obligation to wear Covid masks to the implementation of a hybrid work schedule in which some people work remotely while others work
from office based on the nature of their tasks. In this project we will study social interactions in a company through the representation of a network in order to investigate our solutions for safer workplace interactions. Namely our hypothesis is that isolating specific subsets of nodes which we consider as potential profiles of super spreaders could contribute greatly to the decrease of the covid risk inside the company.

**Dataset**
The dataset used is the Contacts in a workplace dataset released in June 2016. It includes data about social interactions between employees of a french company over a time period of 10 days starting from June 24 to July 3, 2013.
